# BabyLearnsToHack
Hello World! What the fuck is up?!
This is going to be the initial resource dump for everything I think I need to become the 31337 hakz0r I know I'm destined to be.
I was a comp sci major freshman year before switching to finance so my overall goals are pretty simple for this:


# Goal 0x01
I know enough about hacking real goodly like the russianz to know I'm supposed to use Hex for numbers.
The first goal is to submit a bug to a company and have them say thank you. Nothing fancy, just a sign that I actually accomplished my main hacking goal of hacking for good or whatever


# Goal 0x02
Make myself fully regret not studying comp sci, security, systems, or whatever's similar when I was in college


# Goal 0x03
Say something my comp sci/infosec friends are impressed by because of the material itself, not just because I was the one who said it.
